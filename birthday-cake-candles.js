//You are in charge of the cake for your niece's birthday and have decided 
//the cake will have one candle for each year of her total age. 
//When she blows out the candles, sheâ€™ll only be able to blow out the tallest ones. 
//Your task is to find out how many candles she can successfully blow out.
//or example, if your niece is turning 4 years old, and the cake will have 4 candles 
//of height 4, 4, 1, 3, she will be able to blow out 2 candles successfully, 
//since the tallest candles are of height 4 and there are 2 such candles.
